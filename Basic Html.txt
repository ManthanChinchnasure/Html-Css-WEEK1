13 table tag
 The table comprises three main tags: <table>, <tr>, and <td>. 
 The <table> tag defines the table,
  the <tr> tag defines the table rows, 
   the <td> tag defines the table cells.

Here's an example of a basic HTML table:


<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Column1 in Row1</td>
        <td>Column2 in Row1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Column1 in Row2</td>
        <td>Column2 in Row2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

heading tag of table
The <th> tag is used within the <table> tag for defining the heading for your table data.
 It is used as a replacement for the <td> tag, where the table's data must be inserted as a heading.

||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
 These two attributes of the <td> tag are used for merging two or more columns into a single column. 
 It is useful in cases where you want to show mixed data universally for all the headings.

colspan
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Column1 Heading</th>
        <th>Column2 Heading</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Column1 in Row1</td>
        <td>Column2 in Row1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Column1 in Row2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

  rowspa
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Column1 Heading</th>
        <th>Column2 Heading</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Column1 in Row1</td>
        <td>Column2 in Row1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Column2 in Row2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

cell-padding and cell-spaceing attribute 
These two attributes of the <table> tag provides white spaces to your table cells from both sides.
 This is mainly done to beautify and make data within your cells readable. This is how you have to provide value to these attributes:

<table border="2" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="6">

table background and colour
<table border="1" bordercolor="aqua" bgcolor="red">


nesting codeing
<table border="2" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

        <td>A</td>
        <td>B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>
            <table border="2" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <table border="2" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
                            <tr>
                                <td>D</td>
                                <td>E</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>F</td>
                                <td>G</td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                    </td>
                    <td>H</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>I</td>
                    <td>J</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

attribute tag
An attribute is a property name used to provide supplementary information about HTML elements.
 Some common examples of HTML attributes are id, class, align, etc. Many attributes are defined globally and are applied to any element,
  whereas we use some of them only for specific HTML elements. The syntax is:

<element_name attribute_name="value"> .... </element_name>


id
title
class
style

id attribute
The id attribute can be applied to assign a unique identity to any element.
 There can be two primary reasons for using the id attribute on an HTML element.
  The id attribute provides a unique identifier, which ultimately makes it possible to identify the element.
   When you have two elements of the same name within the same script, the id attribute helps to distinguish two similar elements through the unique ID.

<p id="para1"> Paragraph 1 in your HTML document.</p>

<p id="para2"> Paragraph 2 in your HTML document.</p>


title attribute
This attribute gives a recommended title for your element.
 Its behavior depends on the element upon which it's implemented,
  even though this is often implemented to display a tooltip if the cursor hovers (comes over) the element.

<h3 title="Welcome to my Journal">Please visit</h3>

class Attribut
eThis attribute is implemented by combining an element through a stylesheet (CSS) and identifying its class element.
 For more about the class attribute, you can follow the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS).

Here's an example of a class attribute:
<p class="classname1 classname2">This is a sample paragraph text.</p>

style attribute

This attribute gives you a chance for specifying the rules for Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) in your element.


<p style="font-family:arial;">An example of style attribute.</p>
Some other popular HTML attributes are:

Attribute	Usage
align	It is used to align HTML tags horizontally, left, right, or center.
background	It is used to set a background image behind an HTML element
accesskey	It is used to add a specific keyboard shortcut to access an HTML element.
contextmenu	It is used to specify the context menu of an HTML element.
item	It is used to group HTML elements.
hidden	It is used to specify whether your HTML element should be visible or not.

how to add css html
inline css
Inline CSS is the most specific way to add CSS to the HTML element.
 To add inline CSS, include the style attribute in the relevant element and specify any CSS property.
  This way, you can customize the style of individual elements without affecting the rest of the page's design.
   For example, the following inline CSS code applies color and padding to a single paragraph element:

<p style="color: red; padding: 5px;">Red text with padding.</p>

internal css in html 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
    p {
        color: green;
        margin-top: 10px;
    }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Green paragraph with top margin.</p>
</body>
</html>

external css 
External CSS is the most efficient method to style multiple pages.
 To add external CSS, link to a separate CSS file using the HTML <link> element in each HTML page's <head> section.
  For example, the following code links to an external CSS file named style.css:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Styled Heading</h1>
</body>
</html>
